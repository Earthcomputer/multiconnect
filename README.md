Connect to many different server versions from your Fabric client!

## Why another protocol translator?
Multiconnect distinguishes itself from similar projects such as ViaVersion and ProtocolSupport in that it is
very much client-side. Crucially, this means it can (and does) fix many version differences on the client;
such issues are unfixable on the server. As of the time of writing, multiconnect is the only mod which fixes
1.12 swimming mechanics, parkour differences, and re-adds removed features such as command syntax on the client.

On the other hand, multiconnect supports only the latest Minecraft client version, and only on Fabric. It also
does not have as much version coverage as ViaVersion and ProtocolSupport (yet).

### Usage with ViaFabric
If you want to connect to servers older than what multiconnect can currently support, you can install
[ViaFabric](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaFabric) alongside multiconnect, the two are compatible -
multiconnect will translate as much as it can, ViaFabric will take you the rest of the way. Follow the
instructions in the ViaFabric readme for details on how to do this.

### Other alternatives
- [ClientViaVersion](https://github.com/Gerrygames/ClientViaVersion): a discontinued plugin for The 5zig Mod
which supported client versions 1.7.10, 1.8, 1.8.9, 1.12 and 1.12.2.
- [ViaVersion](https://viaversion.com/), [ProtocolSupport](https://protocol.support/): server-side protocol
bridges.

## Installation for Players
1. Download and run the [Fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use).
   - Click the "vanilla" button, leave the other settings as they are,
     and click "download installer".
   - Note: this step may vary if you aren't using the vanilla launcher
     or an old version of Minecraft.
1. Download multiconnect from the [releases page](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/multiconnect/releases)
   and move it to the mods folder (`.minecraft/mods`).

## Installation for Mod Developers
This section is for when you are developing your own mod and want to use the multiconnect API, or run multiconnect alongside your mod in the IDE. Aside from the first step, you ONLY need to follow the steps applicable to you and your mod.
1. Explicitly setting a repository is not necessary, as multiconnect is hosted on Maven Central.
1. If you want to use the API inside your mod, you will have to jar-in-jar it for the release and add it to the classpath. To do this, add the following to your `dependencies {}` block:
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
      // ...
      modImplementation('net.earthcomputer.multiconnect:multiconnect-api:<version>') { transitive = false }
      include('net.earthcomputer.multiconnect:multiconnect-api:<version>') { transitive = false }
   }
   ```
   - Note: replace `<version>` with the version of multiconnect you want to depend on.
   - Note: SKIP the `include` part if your mod is NOT using the API in any way.
1. If you want to run multiconnect in the IDE alongside your mod, add the following to your `dependencies {}` block:
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
      // ...
      modRuntime('net.earthcomputer.multiconnect:multiconnect-slim:<version>') { transitive = false }
   }
   ```
   - Note: the previous step should also be done alongside this step.
   - Note: this step is only necessary if you want to run the full mod in the IDE. Otherwise you can skip this step.

## Contributing
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Earthcomputer/multiconnect
   cd multiconnect
   ```
1. Generate the Minecraft source code
   ```
   ./gradlew genSources
   ```
   - Note: on Windows, use `gradlew` rather than `./gradlew`.
1. Import the project into your preferred IDE.
   1. If you use IntelliJ (the preferred option), you can simply import the project as a Gradle project.
   1. If you use Eclipse, you need to `./gradlew eclipse` before importing the project as an Eclipse project.
1. Edit the code.
1. After testing in the IDE, build a JAR to test whether it works outside the IDE too
   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```
   The mod JAR may be found in the `build/libs` directory
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
   so that your changes can be integrated into multiconnect
   - Note: for large contributions, create an issue before doing all that
     work, to ask whether your pull request is likely to be accepted
